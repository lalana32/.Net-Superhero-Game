# My First .NET Project

## 📌 About the Project
This project was my introduction to .NET development, where I explored key concepts such as **controllers, DTOs, services, authentication**, and more. Although I originally built this project some time ago, I am pushing it now to GitHub for reference and portfolio purposes.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **.NET** (ASP.NET Core)
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **REST API Architecture**

## 🔧 Features
- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations using controllers and services
- Data transfer objects (DTOs) for cleaner API responses

- ## 📝 Notes
- This project was an essential step in my journey as a **.NET developer**.
- Since then, I have worked on several more advanced **.NET + React projects**, which you can check out on my Github profile.
